# Advanced Algorithms & Data Structures
Weekly prac codes for FIT3155- Advanced algorithms & data structures

| Week(i)/Prac(i+1) | Algorithm | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Week 1 | Z-algorithm | O(M+N) linear string searching. Concatenate pat$text |
| Week 2 | Boyer Moore | Used z-algorithm to generate good suffix & matched prefix array. Included Galil's optimization. Code not included for week 2 prac. Reversed Boyer Moore is implemented for Assignment 1. Refer to Assignment1, question 1. |
| Week 2 | KMP | Using z-algorithm to generate SPi values | 
| Week 3 | Ukkonen | 3 rules, 4 tricks. http://web.stanford.edu/~mjkay/gusfield.pdf. Sidenote: It was difficult implementing this and I spent a lot of time thoroughly going through the paper to completely understand the algorithm. |
